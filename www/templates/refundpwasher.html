                    When a CCP is en route to your location, you can use your app to cancel your ride request. Your
                    account may be charged a cancellation fee. This depends on how much time has passed between when the
                    driver accepted your request and when you cancel.
                </div>
                <div style="padding:2%;">
                    CCPs are also able to cancel a request. In this case, you may be charged a cancellation fee if the
                    driver has already waited for several minutes at your given location.
                </div>
                <div style="padding:2%;">
                    Cancellation fees may differ depending on your city. Many cities have a 5 minute charge-free
                    cancellation window. In other cities, you may be charged a fee for cancelling more than 2 minutes
                    after a CCP is en route to your location.
