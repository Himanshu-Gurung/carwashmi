                including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged,

            <h4 style="position:relative;left:4%;">Important Information About Platform Permissions</h4>
            <div style="padding:4%;font-size: 15px; color:#607D8B">
                Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot
                access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your
                consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the CarWashMi app wants permission to access
                certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will
                notify you of the permissions that the CarWashMi app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of
                the app constitutes your consent. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the
                platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we’ve created
                these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our
            </div>
